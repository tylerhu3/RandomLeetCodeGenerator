<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:</p>
<pre>1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
</pre>
<p><code>1</code> is read off as <code>"one 1"</code> or <code>11</code>.<br/>
<code>11</code> is read off as <code>"two 1s"</code> or <code>21</code>.<br/>
<code>21</code> is read off as <code>"one 2</code>, then <code>one 1"</code> or <code>1211</code>.</p>
<p>Given an integer <i>n</i> where 1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 30, generate the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.</p>
<p>Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>
<pre><b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> "1"
<b>Explanation:</b> This is the base case.
</pre>
<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>
<pre><b>Input:</b> 4
<b>Output:</b> "1211"
<b>Explanation:</b> For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
