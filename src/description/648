<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>In English, we have a concept called <code>root</code>, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word <code>successor</code>. For example, the root <code>an</code>, followed by <code>other</code>, which can form another word <code>another</code>.</p>
<p>Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the <code>successor</code> in the sentence with the <code>root</code> forming it. If a <code>successor</code> has many <code>roots</code> can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.</p>
<p>You need to output the sentence after the replacement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dict = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
<strong>Output:</strong> "the cat was rat by the bat"
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The input will only have lower-case letters.</li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= dict.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= dict[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
<li>1 &lt;= sentence words number &lt;= 1000</li>
<li>1 &lt;= sentence words length &lt;= 1000</li>
</ul>
